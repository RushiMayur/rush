# Instagram Fake account detection Machine Learning model using sciKit Learn in Python

Here , Logistic Regression, Support Vector machine, Decision Tree classifier, Random Forest algorithm, Naive Bayes algorithm and Gradient Descent alorithm are used to get to know whether instagram account is fake or not. When we find accuracy of all models, we find out that Random Forest classifier has the highest accuracy in most of predictions.
